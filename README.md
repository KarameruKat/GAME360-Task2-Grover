# Task 3: Complete Patterns Integration

# Project Evolution
# Task 2 Foundation
- **Singleton Pattern:** GameManager, AudioManager
- **Basic game with centralized management**

## Task 3 Additions
## Observer Pattern
- **EventManager for decoupled communication**
- **Events implemented:** Updating Score, Updating Lives Count, Updating Enemy Kill Count, Win Panel, and Lose Panel
- **Observers:** UIManager, Achievements

## State Machine Pattern
- **Player States:** Move and Idle
- **Game States:** Enhanced from Task 2
- **State transitions:** When the idle state detects inputs from the W, A, S, or D keys, the state transitions into the move state. If no input is detected, it returns to the idle state.

### Key Integration Points
**1. Score System:** Singleton → Observer → UI
**2. Player Actions:** Input → State → Event → Audio
**3. Game Flow:** GameState → Events → Scene Changes
